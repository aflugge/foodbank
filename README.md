# Foodbank
Simple website for a foodbank to specify what items they need.

shoppingList.js specifies item that are required and gives each a weight. Items are then selected randomly but weighted by their weight, i.e. if an item has twice the weight it is twice as likely to be selected next. Items with weight zero are always select last.
